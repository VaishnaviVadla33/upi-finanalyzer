# UPI Financial Analyzer
![Dashboard Screenshot](Dashboard_image.png)

UPI Financial Analyzer is a comprehensive web application designed to help users track their Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions efficiently. Users can upload screenshots of their transaction confirmations, and the application uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract relevant details like amount, date, time, and sender/receiver. This data is then stored in user-specific collections and can be visualized on a comprehensive financial dashboard, offering insights into spending patterns, cash flow, and potential savings.

The application utilizes Flask for the backend, Firebase Firestore for database storage with user-specific data isolation, and various Python libraries for OCR and data analysis. The frontend provides an intuitive interface for user registration, login, uploading images, viewing transaction history, and exploring the interactive dashboard.
